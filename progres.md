#Progress by Alejandro

* Blender version installed 3.3 with python 3.10.2 ( import sys print(sys.version_info) in python console )
* Hello world , first aproaches with default library bpy 
  * To use on the blender python text IDE it is necessary to import bpy , but on other hand if you are on the line by line interpreter is imported by default.
  * Access to a blender object example bpy.data.objects['Cube']
* It is not a nice IDE to work on blender python editor, I can imagine that it is better to match version and them use visual code.. on going....

Visual Code
* Plugins
